				<hr>
				​<p>We at FJU believe that well-educated people should be able to teach themselves what they want and need to know without being dependent on a teacher.  It is our long-term goal to help learners become well educated by means of their acquisition of the knowledge and skills needed to be self-directed life-long learners.  In some situations, it may be more convenient for a well-educated person to have someone else (e.g. a teacher) organize, design, implemented, and deliver learning experiences that can help a learner to quickly pick up new knowledge and develop new skills, especially when little has been written about them. Being freed of a dependence on teachers is, however, very empowering.  What is learned, how it is learned, the speed of learning, and the costs are all in the well-educated learner’s control and the more one learns this way, the faster and better at it one becomes.</p>

			<p>Starting on this path requires an active and engaged learner.  Most learn very little, if anything, if the only activity is listening in lecture-based courses.  Now it is true that a wonderful and compelling lecture is a thing to behold and it seems that we should applaud the performance at the end, even if that seldom is done.  After all, such lectures are a performance that demands an array of skills that are rare and sadly absent in many who try to lecture.  Well-educated people distinguish effective learning from entertainment by assessing what they have learned and are able to do with to do with it.</p>
			<p>Teaching is about delivering a sequence of experiences designed to transform learners from some initial state to a desired final state on a trajectory toward goals they are likely to achieve in their education and then career.  Teachers must also appreciate that each learner is unique and truly meaningful transitions are seldom accomplished in a single common step.  School is not a “knowledge filling station” and a class is not about passively sitting there while the teacher pours “five more gallons of knowledge” into learners’ brains. Rather, knowledge is the reward one earns from experiences that force one to gather, manipulate, and work with important information by means of developing new and using previously acquired skills to accomplish the course goals and outcomes.  It is this integration of knowledge and skills leading to better and ever more sophisticated capabilities that is key, not just the number of subjects covered.</p>
			<p>Information is the basis of knowledge and our world today is very different from the time of the founding of the premier institutions of higher education.  Textbooks were rare and very expensive.  The publishing process was time consuming and the gap from key discoveries to distribution of books that cover them took far too long.  Libraries were not common and usually were only available to the privileged few or those they sponsored.  Lecturing became a practical way for scholars with books to share the contents with a much larger collection of interested learners.</p>
			<p>The Internet changed all of this. Fully online books are now quite common and the competition among publishers and new information sources is beginning to bring prices down.  Linking online textbooks with focused videos of specific nuggets of knowledge is now common and many are asking why one really needs the traditional 50-minute lectures at all, be they face-to-face or captured in a video.</p>
			<p>At FJU, the focus of teachers is not on creating, delivering, and maintaining lectures.  Rather, we want them diagnosing what is blocking the progress of learners, supporting their actual needs, and striving to help them develop learning strategies and skills so they can learn what they want when they want by themselves.  In most situations, already captured videos and textbooks are just fine at delivering the information the learners need as well as help them exercise and practice their skills. </p>
			<p>Occasionally, learners will have difficulty apply new information to a practical problem.  The “solution” is not to give the learner the answer or even point them to where the answer can be found.  The best “solution” is to ask questions about the nature of the difficulty, to ask how the learner has overcome similar difficulties in the past, and work with the learner to the point where a path forward is now clear. Initially, a Socratic approach can be frustrating to the learner and hard on the teacher, but once these “learning to learn” skills have been mastered, progress picks up dramatically and much less time is wasted.</p>
			<p>Our curricula have been architected and designed to gracefully move students from the basics and foundations, to more advanced and sophisticated levels of accomplishment by means of a number of modest-sized experiences.  Few critical and valuable lessons are fully masters after only a single experience.  Often several iterations from different perspectives is needed before all of the necessary aspects can fall into place and the “eureka” moment occurs.  To ensure these lessons (both the knowing and the doing) have been truly learned, practical projects are performed giving the learners the opportunity to demonstrate what they are able to do and how they do it.</p>
			<p>We design our experiences to fit together, to flow, to reinforce one another, and to carrying the learner to higher and more sophisticated levels of accomplishment.  Central to our design approach is the insight that we teachers have choices when it comes to what we ask the learner to do to show that the information has been received and can be used (with previously learned information and skills) to solve interesting and useful problems.  Why choose those experiences that only address the specific lesson at hand when the goal is the integration of knowledge and skills?  Why not choose those experiences that extend and reinforce previous lessons while addressing today’s goals?  Doing double or triple duty with the course work takes extra effort in the design and makes providing feedback more challenging, but this approach asks learner to develop up to and perform at precisely the level business wants and society needs.  Choosing single topic exercises and employing easy-to-grade questions does little to produce job ready graduates.</p><br>
			<h2>Learning by doing</h2>
			<p>It’s such a simple thing to say and it makes sense to so many, one can only wonder why it isn’t just the way all classes are taught.  In truth, before education became big business for the privileged, most learning was “by doing” as in the master-apprentice model.  Masters, working on paying jobs, would allocate bits and pieces of the work to various apprentices.  Some of the more advanced would produce suitable work and have their contributions included in the final deliverable, while the work of others would be found to be lacking and was used as a learning experience on how to do the work better next time.  If apprentices didn’t learn and begin to produce work products good enough to be used after working with the master for a reasonable length of time, they were dismissed and others were given a chance.</p>
			<p>The notion of doing actual work as opposed to just listening to lectures and taking tests to prove that you were paying attention to the lecture is not new.  Professors regularly claim to implement learning by doing in their classes.  The problem is that many who make such claims do not require the learners to follow the processes or use the tools that professionals would, or do work the same way one would expect paid professionals to do it.  In fact, most of the “doing” found in these courses is often solving isolated toy problems with little to none of the real world complexity that makes being a professional so challenging.  When problems are small and isolated, almost any solution approach, even a random one, can be made to work.  This is “hacking” and is not the application of reason, applying science, mathematics, and the important lessons that are at the heart of being a professional.  When the hidden flaws in hacked-together work never come back to bite students, the real lessons about being a professional, so important to business, are seldom learned.  Learners are not successful when they are able to hide their flaws, fool their professors and obtain grades that are not a fair reflection of what they actually can do.  At some point, they will be forced to perform what they claimed they could do, and failing in business is much worse than failing in a course.  This is especially true when a school allows students to learn from their failures and then practice the correct solutions until the results are automatic.</p><br>
			<h2>Bloom’s Taxonomy and other Models</h2>
			<p>Central to the design of our programs is the recognition that becoming job ready means being able to do the work that professionals do.  Our learning experiences are designed to flow from the more basic activities that ask learners to work well with facts doing things such as: listing, recognizing, summarizing, and classifying.  These are very important foundational capabilities that must be mastered before one can do the truly valuable and important activities such as: judge, reflect, design, and create.  A Revision of Bloom’s Taxonomy for Educational Objectives <a id="1ref" href="#ref1">[1]</a> provides one way of thinking about the progression of the kinds of things learners should be able to do after taking more and more advanced courses.  Advancement is not just about taking more courses and pouring more facts into our brains.  It is about integrating information, developing new capabilities, and building upon previously learned knowledge and skills with the goal of finding novel solutions to thorny problems others are unwilling or unable to tackle.</p>
			<p>We at FJU draw value from a number of educational and learning models.  The story-centered curriculum and cognitive learning processes at the heart of Roger Schank’s work <a id="2ref" href="#ref2">[2]</a> have proven most useful. </p>
			<p>Why not choose to enhance learning experiences so that in addition to the primary goal of the experience, learners develop the ability to:</p>
			<ul style="color: black; font-size: 16px">
				<li><p>model and then predict, </p></li>
				<li><p>evaluate and experiment, </p></li>
				<li><p>diagnose and then plan to address what has been discovered,</p></li>
				<li><p>recognize, assess, and then know there is a true causal relationship and when there isn’t (regardless of what an ill-conceived correlation may say), </p></li>
				<li><p>make defendable judgments, </p></li>
				<li><p>describe and influence people, </p></li>
				<li><p>work effectively in a team, </p></li>
				<li><p>and successfully find the often sought after win-win in a negotiation.  </p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>These critical skills are at the heart of a truly educated individual and like most things of value, the more they are practiced and the more realistic the context, the better the lessons will be learned and be able to be used.</p><br>
			<h2>Coaches and coaching assistants</h2>
			<p>We use the word “coach” to describe the FJU teacher that directly interacts with the learner.  It is the coach that that the learner must please, as the coach is the one who assesses progress and certifies what the learner can do.  While coaches work with other curricular experts to improve courses, the design, creation, and maintenance of courses is not their focus.  Coaches also may work with coaching assistants who review the way work is being done, what is being produced, and distinguish between expected results and the unexpected.  It is the coach that further assesses unexpected work, positive or negative, in order to decide how best to respond and provide feedback.  (E.g., Is the learner ready to skip ahead?  Should the learner redo some work or do some alternate work?  What is the best way to engage with the learner?)</p>
			<p>Coaches regularly engage synchronously (either virtually or face-to-face) with groups of students (be they teams or cohorts) and are available for individual sessions (either scheduled or during posted “office hours”).  The purpose of these sessions is to surface issues, answer questions, and provide a unique perspective to help motivate learners when the going gets tough.  Coaches survey what learners do, how they do it, and what issues they seem to be encountering.  From this they generate materials (e.g. FAQs, short screencasts, articles, new examples, new exercise and practice activities, and enhanced assessment processes and standard tailorable feedback) to help learners, coaching assistants, and themselves better achieve course and program goals. </p><br>
			<h2>Assessments</h2>
			<p>Begin able to determine what learners know and are able to do is important.  Being able to assess the extent to which learners can do what businesses want and society needs crucial.  Traditional true/false and multiple-choice tests are seldom adequate for either task.</p>
			<p>We at FJU try to devise and use assessments that actually provide both the coaches but also the learner with actionable information.  Our strategic goal is to shift the focus of assessments from providing valuable information to the coaches to providing it to the learners.  After all, professionals must know for themselves what they can actually do and how their performance compares to what others can do.  If professionals are not satisfied with an unbiased assessment of their capabilities and they are effective self-directed learners, they can take action to change their capabilities.</p>
			<p>While the traditional test may not be effective strategically, they can be useful tactically to assist coaches and learners assess the extent to which basic information has been learned.  The major advantage of these assessments is that they can be automated and provide immediate feedback to the learner.  When used this way, it is possible to speed the learning of foundational vocabulary, concepts, and other lower-level Bloom capabilities.</p>
			<p>To avoid the “teaching to the test” problem about which many complain, we at FJU strive to employ actual work performance assessments and portfolio evaluations in our process to assign grades and to certify program completion.  We believe that final measures of success at FJU should be similar to, if not identical, to how businesses and society does it.  So we may use tests, but they are seldom used to assign grades and are a minor contributor when we do.</p><br><br>
