			<p>FJU is a non-profit university, catering to working professionals and gifted youth from low income families who need new and/or additional skills to survive in the changing work place.  Unlike our fore fathers who went to college for 4 years and worked in one company for the rest of their life, it is said that newly graduating students may have seven or more careers in a lifetime.  Even if one does not change jobs, work place requirements change continuously. The skill sets needed are not usually taught in a conventional undergraduate programs.  Rapid technological changes further exacerbate the situation requiring new skills and capabilities.</p>

			<p>FJUâ€™s mission is to provide affordable, quality education to gifted youth from around the world who desire to acquire new skills. The online learning paradigm used by FJU requires that every student should have access to connectivity and computing. The learning process is conveniently tailored around work place demands, and takes place in the evenings and weekends.  FJU offers Certificate, Diploma and Degree programs with flexible schedules. FJU programs are tailored around emerging technologies and best practices.</p>

			<p>FJU invites talented and gifted youth to apply. Each student is assigned an expert Coach at the time of registering for the course who will be available for the duration of the course.  The instructional process is based on learning by doing methodology. The Coach holds regularly scheduled online evening sessions for an hour or so during the weekdays and longer sessions over the weekends. Interaction with the Coach and among students is primarily expected to be via Skype video-conferencing. Face to face interaction may also be possible where circumstances permit.</p>

			<p>For students from low income families, 50% of the tuition is deferred with optional payment plans.</p>

			<p>Each Student is assigned an Advisor/Counsellor (usually the Dean of Academic Affairs) at the time of initial enrollment who will work out a plan of study. Students will need to commit atleast 10 to 20 hours of study per week, although full time study of 40 hours per week is also permitted. </p>

			<p>The medium of instruction is English. Remedial education will be available for non-native speakers.</p>
