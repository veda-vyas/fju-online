			<h3>Overview</h3>
			<p>Our goal is to transition learners to educational independence.  At FJU, we believe that all serious and disciplined learners should be able to master "learning how to learn" using the Internet. We then believe, after practice and skill development coaching, they can learn just about anything that is available on the Internet without needing to go back to school or being required to pay large sums of money.</p>
			<p>Many well-deserving learners have no realistic path forward to the education they need to get a job.  A four-year education at a traditional "brick and mortar" school may be the right choice for some, but many firms need good workers with far less.  A four-year education as offered by many schools, even with a “full ride” scholarship that includes room and board, is just not an option for many who must help take care of their family.</p>
			<p>In a period of roughly six months, full-time, dedicated, hardworking, mature learners can earn a certificate showing the achievement of job-ready skills.  With a job, learners are able to support themselves, help their families, and continue to learn as needed to achieve their personal goals without incurring huge debt.</p><br>
			<h3>Learning to Learn</h3>
			<p>We sincere desire to help as many hardworking, mature, disciplined, and able people as possible to obtain a great education.  The first thing they must master is our process of learning to learn, leveraging the Internet.  The Internet has fundamentally changed the way people can learn.  Given an adequate computer with a reasonable Internet connection and a solid grasp of English (reading, writing, listening, and speaking), the people we desire to help can benefit from an on-line education once they have mastered our way of learning to learn.</p>
			<p>Our learning process begins by setting goals, laying out a plan and schedule (following our process), committing to the plan, schedule, and process, and then implementing the plan.  Unlike how many have learned to learn in school before, success here is not tied to scoring well on a test.  Even producing what appears to be the right deliverables is not enough, but it is important.  One must follow the prescribed process, proving that the process was followed, and the required results were produced.</p>
			<p>We know that everyone will encounter something they don’t know, be it a word, a concept, a procedure, or something else.  That should not stop you.  Just like learning to use a dictionary to figure out how to spell words, at first it can be very frustrating.  (E.g. “If I can’t spell the word, how can I look it up in the dictionary in order to figure out how to spell it?”)  With a little practice and some coaching, just about every adult has figured out how to do it.  The same is true with the Internet.  Initially, the vast list of results returned by a search engine seems overwhelming.  After some practice and coaching, it becomes much easier to figure out how to produce effective queries and make sense of what is returned.  There are many reasonable places one can go for information and to develop skills <a id="ref1" href="#1ref">[1]</a>: Wikipedia, courses from Khan Academy, Udacity, or Coursera, YouTube videos, web pages, and other references. Real learning is not a smooth and direct path to your goal.  There will be barriers, bumps, and failures.  Each of these teaches you something about the world and yourself and makes reaching your destination that much more satisfying.</p><br>
			<h3>The Preparatory Course</h3>
			<p>Every learner joining FJU must take an initial Preparatory Course, regardless of which program or certificate is being sought.  In addition to introducing you to your coach, by the end of this course, you will be able to:</p>
			<ul style="color: black; font-size: 16px"> 
				<li><p>Use your computer and other Internet connected devices safely and effectively to access and use our learning materials, on-line tools, and program specific materials and tools.</p></li>
				<li><p>Access and effectively use key sources of information you will be expected to use, along with other sources you will discover, during your studies.</p></li>
				<li><p>Follow our “learning to learn” approach to proactively gather and integrate information, build insights, develop skills, assess capabilities, effectively receive feedback, and practice as needed to improve in order to become less dependent on others.</p></li>
				<li><p>Demonstrate the willingness and ability to understand and follow both the letter and the spirit of instructions and establish a schedule and then follow it.</p></li>
				<li><p>Continue toward becoming an independent, self-directed, life-long learner.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>These preparatory courses are typically four weeks in length, though we expect some learners will be able to move through these courses much more quickly.</p><br>
			<h3>Typical Courses</h3>
			<p>Most certificates are composed of three to four courses plus a practicum project and require six full-time months to complete.  A typical course is four full-time weeks long and some are further partitioned into a two mini-courses of two full-time weeks each.</p>
			<p>A course consists of a collection of information that must be learned, a related set of exercises with self-assessment support, and practice activities.</p>
			<ul style="color: black; font-size: 16px">
				<li><p>Each FJU class is documented as a sequence of day-by-day activities.  Based on the learning contract into which you entered and a schedule you established, you have a specific list of things to do (class meetings, information learning activities, exercises, assessments, practices activities, and project activities) and when they will be done.  You will be grouped with other students who have entered into similar learning contracts with compatible schedules into a cohort.</p></li>
				<li><p>The information to be learned is typically provided via written materials and/or video materials.  In some cases, information is provided to you in a blended manner so it is possible to learn the information by reading or watching/listening about it, or a combination of both.  You will be given reading assignments from a book or pointers to web pages to read, links to videos to watch, and/or other information sources to use.</p></li>
				<li><p>Each set of information to be learned is coupled with an exercise and a self-assessment.  These exercises are designed to both verify your understanding of the material and to help you to start integrating your understanding with previous lessons and concepts and prepare for future information.  The self-assessment makes it clear to you if you have properly learned the new information and are able to begin to integrate it with other information, concepts, and developing skills.  These self-assessments are not grading tools, but coaches use them to help design custom activities in case a learner is having difficulties.</p></li>
				<li><p>Practice activities go beyond exercising by asking the learner to apply aspects of the information being learned to the solution of elements of a realistic or real-world project.  High-context practice and project work is critical if the learner is to move up in capabilities and develop the skills needed to be truly job-ready.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Courses are composed of a set of scheduled group activities with the coach, an hour or two each day, and six to seven hours (maybe more, from time to time, if you run into difficulties) of individual, pair, and/or small teamwork sessions.</p>
			<p>Daily sessions with the coach are times to ask questions and discuss issues relating to the materials and their application to problems and work products in the real world.  The best use of this time is to ask questions about materials that have already been studied and after trying to employ all of the learning-to-learn skills.</p>
			<p>Learners are expected to perform information gathering and understanding activities during their individual time before investing class time with the coach on questions.  These activities includes reading the textbook, reading assigned articles, watching videos, using the Internet, exploring FAQs, and using other provided materials.  When you believe you have learned the materials, try the exercises and the self-assessments to verify your understanding and to guide you back to those elements that were not adequately understood.</p>
			<p>When the exercises and self-assessments suggest you understand the material, you should then be ready to practice what you have learned on aspects of a project that runs in across the course and may be related to the project on which you will work after the courses are done.  The actual doing or real work in the context of actual projects is a crucial aspect of the FJU program.  Getting “the right answer” is desirable, but doing the work the way you were taught and asked is critical if you are to be successful working with and for others.  Success at FJU requires that you “do the right work and do the work right”, the essence of verification and validation in the professional world.</p><br>
			<h3>Practicum Projects</h3>
			<p>Effective learning happens best when the lessons can be practiced doing work that is as close to the work one would do on the job, using the same tools and processes, as possible.  FJU provides this context-rich, immersive, practice experiences on realistic if not on real projects.  Some project work is woven into the course work, so the gap between learning and applying it is not too large.  Project work is also iterative, some during courses and some at the end of the certificate.  This repetition gives the learner the opportunity to further practice, hone, and try the lessons in varying situations.</p>
			<p>Projects are drawn from the real work and from FJU partner organizations.  In each case, there is a project advocate who cares about the work, provides insights, details, requirements, and the rationale behind the work in order to better understand the motivation and the significance of it.  Interaction with and feedback from this advocate is crucial.</p><br><br>
